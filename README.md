# Project2

## Heatmap
I'm made a heatmap of what our service would look like if like 2500 people use it

We've used python3 for this project\
To run the script, install these dependencies\
pip3 install numpy \
pip3 install pandas \
pip3 install matplotlib

To run it \
python3 heatmap.py

![heatmap](heatmap/heatmapimg.png)


server.py and client.py:\
python3 client.py (open as many terminal windows as clients you desire)\
python3 sever.py (1 window on the terminal)

At the moment very basic functionality:\
    Clients connect to server and are asked about whether or not they want to take a COVID-19 test.\
    If server exits, clients do as well.
