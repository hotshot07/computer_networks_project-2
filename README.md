## Heatmap
I'm made a heatmap of what our service would look like if like 2500 people use it

We've used python3 for this project\
To run the script, install these dependencies\
pip3 install numpy \
pip3 install pandas \
pip3 install matplotlib

python3 heatmap.py

## Client-server

Functionality:\
    Clients connect to server and are asked to introduce a username.\
    They take a Covid19 survey and answer multiple questions.\
    Depending on the answers, the client is recommeded to take a test or it's informed that he/she is fine.\
    If server stops running, clients stop as well.
    
To run files:\
python3 server.py (1 window on the terminal)\
python3 client.py (open as many terminal windows as clients you desire)\
Important to start server process before any client.
